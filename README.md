In order to use Zoom Launcher, you need to create an OAuth app and authorize it to access your calendar:

1. Go to https://console.developers.google.com and create a new project
2. Click "Credentials" on the left side and create a new credential for that project
3. Create a new OAuth credential, and download the resulting JSON file
4. Move the file to `~/.config/google/client_secrets.json`
5. Run `zoom auth` and follow the instructions to authorize the app

## Pro-tip

Set Zoom to open with video and audio disabled for your own safety.
